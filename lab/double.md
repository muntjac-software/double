# Double
*Initial ideas*

<br>

* double.muntjac.io
* No ads
* Host on AWS (free trial) or what about github pages (free) - ask Hayden?
* A game to keep your mental maths sharp

<br>

* Allow 1h labs work on a Sunday (easy upskill time, during meals) running up to OP JINGLE
* Smash out a beta release by EOY (OP JINGLE)
* Spend 1h each Saturday AM to get a proper stable release out (Easter?)

<br>

* MVP:
    * Randomly generated 7 questions - mental maths problems - to challenge your thinking and keep you sharp
    * Provide a standard - challenging, progressive (use a cookie to track progression - globle-like?)
    * It is expected that you get them right, what you want to do is do it faster perhaps
    * No time limit, or stick 2 mins on it? or perhaps the 
* Future iteration: backend with users...

    5 + 17 = 22
    7 * 101 = 707
    123 / 3 = 41
    764 - 98 = 666
    76 * 4 = 304
    34 + 55 = 89
    34 * 78 = 2662


<br>

* Design:
    * See sheet on paper
    * Github (logged out) main page is an excellent standard
