# Double
*Initial ideas*

<br>

* double.muntjac.io
* No ads
* Host on AWS (free trial) or what about github pages (free) - ask Hayden?

<br>

* Allow 1h labs work on a Sunday (easy upskill time, during meals) running up to OP JINGLE
* Smash out a beta release by EOY (OP JINGLE)
* Spend 1h each Saturday AM to get a proper stable release out (Easter?)

<br>

* MVP
    * Guess the monarch based off of info (reign, monarch #, notable achievement, dominion, house)
    * Design:
        * 'Painting' of Monarch (silhoutted)
        * Globe of dominion

<br>

* Design:
    * See sheet on paper
    * Github (logged out) main page is an excellent standard
