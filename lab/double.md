# Double
*Initial ideas*

<br>

* double.muntjac.io
* No ads
* Host on AWS (free trial) or what about github pages (free) - ask Hayden?
* A game to keep your mental maths sharp

<br>

* Allow 1h labs work on a Sunday (easy upskill time, during meals) running up to OP JINGLE
* Smash out a beta release by EOY (OP JINGLE)
* Spend 1h each Saturday AM to get a proper stable release out (Easter?)

<br>

* MVP:
    * 10 mental maths problems - to challenge your thinking and keep you sharp
    * Randomly generated 7 questions
    * Provide a standard - challenging, progressive (use a cookie to track progression - globle-like?)
* Future iteration: backend with users...

    34 * 78 = 

<br>

* Design:
    * See sheet on paper
    * Github (logged out) main page is an excellent standard
